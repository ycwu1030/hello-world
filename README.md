## Reason for this new account
Few days ago, my computer crashed with several important files/codes disappeared. I worked on them for several weeks. It's a sad story and makes me deciding that I should save all codes in some safe place. Github is a good place, it offers a place to store all my codes, and I can also use the version control system to organize the develop procedure. I'm new here, so I need to learn lots about it. Let's start!
